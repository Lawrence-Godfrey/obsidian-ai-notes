This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault contains notes on just about everything I've learned about AI, or at least the stuff that I thought were important enough to write down. In other words, [Hypomnemata](https://foucault.info/documents/foucault.hypomnemata.en/).

Obsidian has some nice features like [forward](https://help.obsidian.md/link-notes) and [backward](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/backlinks) links, [graph views](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/graph), etc., but all the notes are just markdown, so you can use them in any markdown editor or viewer.

To use this vault in Obsidian:
 - Clone this repo locally.
 - In Obsidian, click **File** > **Open Vault**.
 - Click the button next to **Open folder as vault**. 
 - Select the local repo.

## Structure
I've tried to organise the notes into folders by topic, but it's not perfect.
[[AI/Machine Learning & Data Science/README|Machine Learning & Data Science]] contains the bulk of the notes, from basic concepts to more advanced. 
[[AI/Research Paper Explanations/README|Research Paper Explanations]] contains notes which I usually take while reading research papers. I try and make these as informative as possible, with images, diagrams, etc. The research papers are usually seminal papers in their respective fields. 

## What is Learning?

Arthur Samuel (1959)
 > Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Tom Mitchell (1998) 
 > Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
